# PHP
Here are some of my projects written in PHP

## Meeter From Here - Backend

Backend for my software engineering final task. Entire project was written with Krzysztof Drużycki and Dawid Weiss. <br/>
Project lets users plan meets with other users and helps you by searching places that is close to each participant. <br/>
My role was most of backend. GeneratePlaces.php, event.php, login files and database.sql written with Krzysztof Drużycki's help. <br/>
Some files (like private/connect.php) are not here due to private reasons. <br/>
Documentation was written in Polish. <br/>
